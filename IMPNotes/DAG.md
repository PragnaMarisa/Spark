# 🔷 DAG in Apache Spark

## 📌 What is a DAG?

A **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** is a **graph of computation** in Spark where:

- **Directed**: Each step points to the next (order matters).  
- **Acyclic**: No step loops back (no cycles).  
- **Graph**: Nodes represent operations or data (like RDDs), and edges represent dependencies.

---

## 🧠 Why DAG in Spark?

- DAG helps Spark **plan** and **optimize** execution.  
- It enables **fault tolerance** via **lineage**.  
- Spark breaks a DAG into **stages** for parallel execution.

## 🔗 DAG vs Lineage

| Term        | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lineage** | Logical history of how a dataset (RDD/DataFrame) was built |
| **DAG**     | Graph representation of this lineage                     |

✅ Spark **internally represents lineage as a DAG**.

## 🔍 Visual Example

```scala
val raw = sc.textFile("logs.txt")
val errors = raw.filter(_.contains("ERROR"))
val timestamps = errors.map(_.split(" ")(0))
timestamps.saveAsTextFile("errors_out")
```

### DAG Representation:

```
textFile("logs.txt")
       ↓
filter (contains "ERROR")
       ↓
map (extract timestamp)
       ↓
saveAsTextFile("errors_out")
```

Each operation forms a **node**, and edges show **data dependencies**.

---

## ⚙️ Execution Flow

1. Transformations like `map`, `filter` build the DAG (**lazy**).
2. Actions like `saveAsTextFile` trigger **job execution**.
3. Spark analyzes the DAG, splits it into **stages**.
4. Each stage runs as a **task set** across the cluster.

---

## 🛡️ Fault Tolerance via DAG

- If a partition fails, Spark **recomputes** it using the **lineage DAG**.  
- No need to persist intermediate results manually.

# DAG and Shuffling in Apache Spark

## DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

### Definition
The **DAG** represents the logical sequence of transformations and their dependencies in Spark. It's a blueprint that Spark creates before executing jobs, showing how operations are grouped into **stages** for execution.

### Components of DAG
- **Nodes**: Represent RDDs or DataFrames
- **Edges**: Represent transformations (dependencies)
- **Stages**: Groups of tasks that can run in parallel
- **Jobs**: Triggered by actions, composed of multiple stages

### DAG Creation Process
1. **Transformations** build up the logical plan
2. **Actions** trigger DAG creation
3. **Catalyst optimizer** optimizes the plan (for DataFrames/SQL)
4. **DAG Scheduler** breaks it into stages
5. **Task Scheduler** executes individual tasks

### Example DAG Flow
```scala
val lines = sc.textFile("input.txt")         // Stage 1: Read
val words = lines.flatMap(_.split(" "))      // Stage 1: FlatMap  
val pairs = words.map(word => (word, 1))     // Stage 1: Map
val counts = pairs.reduceByKey(_ + _)        // Stage 2: ReduceByKey (shuffle)
counts.saveAsTextFile("output")              // Stage 3: Save
```

## ✅ Summary

- DAG = **Directed Acyclic Graph** of transformations.  
- It is **Spark's backbone** for execution planning and recovery.  
- Built from **RDD/DataFrame transformations**.  
- Used for **optimizing**, **scheduling**, and **recovering** jobs.
